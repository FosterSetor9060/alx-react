## Tasks

### 0. Basic setup
**Mandatory | Score: 0.0%**

- Create and run Webpack using a basic installation.
- Create a folder named `task_0`.
- Install `webpack` and `webpack-cli` as developer dependencies using npm.
- Install `jQuery` as a regular dependency using npm.
- Ensure `webpack` and `webpack-cli` are listed under `devDependencies` and `jQuery` under `dependencies` in `package.json`.
- Create a `src` directory with an `index.js` file that imports jQuery and adds three paragraphs to the page body:
  - Holberton Dashboard
  - Dashboard data for the students
  - Copyright - Holberton School
- Create a `dist/index.html` and import your `main.js` in the body.
- Use jQuery to add elements to the body of the page.
- When running Webpack, your JavaScript and HTML files should be generated in a `dist` folder.
- Do not use a custom Webpack config file.
- Ensure no errors in the console when opening your main file.
- Your HTML code should only import one JavaScript script (the one generated by Webpack).
- Do not push your `dist/main.js` if you have one.

**Repo:**
- GitHub repository: `alx-react`
- Directory: `0x00-Webpack`
- Files: `task_0/package.json`, `task_0/src/index.js`, `task_0/dist/index.html`

### 1. Learning how to use Webpack with a config file
**Mandatory | Score: 0.0%**

- Create a folder named `task_1`, cd into it, and create a `package.json` using `npm init -y`.
- Install `webpack` (dev dependency), `jQuery` (dependency), and `Lodash` (dependency) using npm.
- Modify `package.json` to add a build script that runs Webpack to create a production build (`npm run build`).
- Create a `js` directory with a `dashboard_main.js` file that imports jQuery and adds the following elements:
  - Paragraph: Holberton Dashboard
  - Paragraph: Dashboard data for the students
  - Button: Click here to get started
  - Paragraph: `<p id='count'></p>`
  - Paragraph: Copyright - Holberton School
- Write a function `updateCounter()` to track button clicks and update the count.
- Bind the debounce function in Lodash to the button click event.
- When running Webpack, your JavaScript should be generated in a `public` folder, and `index.html` should be placed there.
- The generated JavaScript file should be named `bundle.js`.
- Set Webpack config mode to production.
- Ensure no errors in the console when opening your HTML file.
- Your HTML code should only import one JavaScript script (the one generated by Webpack).

**Resources:**
- Debounce documentation on Lodash

**Repo:**

- Directory: `0x00-Webpack`
- Files: `task_1/package.json`, `task_1/js/dashboard_main.js`, `task_1/public/index.html`
