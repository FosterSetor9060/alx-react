0x06. React Immutable
Front-end Specialization
Overview
The “0x06. React Immutable” project focuses on immutability in JavaScript using the Immutable.js library. Understanding immutable objects and their benefits is crucial for building robust and predictable applications. By the end of this project, you’ll be able to explain the importance of immutability and demonstrate its implementation using Immutable.js.

Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you’ll be able to explain the following topics without relying on external resources:

Immutable Objects:
Understand the concept of immutability and its advantages.
Learn how to use the Immutable.js library to create and manipulate immutable data structures.
Differences Between List and Map:
Understand the differences between List and Map in Immutable.js.
Know when to use each data structure.
Merge, Concat, and Deep Merging:
Learn how to merge and concatenate immutable collections.
Understand deep merging and its use cases.
Lazy Seq:
Explore lazy sequences (Seq) in Immutable.js.
Understand their benefits and when to use them.
Requirements
General:
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
A README.md file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
All of your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Node 12.x.x and npm 6.x.x
All of your files should end with a new line
All of your functions must be exported
Tasks
0. Converting into an Immutable Object using fromJS
In a file named 0-fromjs.js, create a function getImmutableObject that accepts an object as a parameter and converts it into an immutable Map using fromJS from the Immutable.js library.
1. Converting into Immutable using Map
In 1-map.js, modify the function getImmutableObject using Map from Immutable.js.
2. Accessing Nested Elements
