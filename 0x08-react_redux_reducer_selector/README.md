0x05. React State
Front-end Specialization
Overview
In the “0x05. React State” project, we’ll dive into managing state within React components. Understanding state and its lifecycle is crucial for building interactive and dynamic user interfaces. By the end of this project, you’ll be able to explain key concepts related to state, lifecycle, controlled components, and React Hooks.

Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you’ll be able to explain the following topics without relying on external resources:

State of a Component or Container:
Understand what component state is and how it differs from props.
Know when to use local state within a component.
Component Lifecycle:
Understand the different phases of a component’s lifecycle (e.g., mounting, updating, unmounting).
Know how to execute code at specific points in the lifecycle.
Modifying State and Execution Order:
Understand how to modify state using setState.
Know the correct order of execution for state updates.
Controlled Components:
Understand the concept of controlled components.
Know how to create controlled forms in React.
Form Handling:
Understand how to use forms in React.
Know how to handle form input changes and submit events.
Component Reusability and State Lifting:
Understand how to reuse smaller components and keep them pure.
Know how to lift state to principal containers.
React Hooks:
Understand the use of React Hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect).
Know how to create custom hooks.
Testing State Changes with Enzyme:
Understand how to test state changes using Enzyme.
